In this project we are going to analyze the FBI Gun Data. This data comes from the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) and its used to check whether a prospective buyer is eligible to purchase firearm.

Gun_data - contains number of state-by-state firearms background checks initiated through the NICS
US_Census_Data - contains several state metrics


Questions:

- What is the overall trend of gun/firearm checks?

- Which states are the top five highest in total background checks for issuance (1998-2017) of hand guns & long guns?

- What is the correlation between mean gun (issuance of hand guns & long guns only) checks per state and the following state metrics:
		- Black or African American alone, percent
		- White alone, percent
		- Persons in poverty, percent
		- Bachelor's degree or higher, percent of persons age 25 years+
		- Persons under 18 years, percent
		- Persons 65 years and over, percent
