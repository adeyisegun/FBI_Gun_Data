This project focuses on analyzing the FBI Gun Data sourced from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The dataset is utilized to verify the eligibility of prospective firearm buyers. Additionally, the project incorporates the US Census Data, which provides various state-level metrics.

The analysis aims to address the following key questions:

Overall Trend of Gun/Firearm Checks:
Explore the trend of gun/firearm checks over the specified time period to identify any significant patterns or fluctuations.

Top Five States with the Highest Total Background Checks for Handguns & Long Guns:
Identify the top five states with the highest total number of background checks issued for hand guns and long guns between 1998 and 2017.

Correlation between Mean Gun Checks per State and State Metrics:
Investigate the correlation between the mean number of gun checks (specifically for hand guns and long guns) per state and several state-level metrics, including:

Black or African American alone, percent
White alone, percent
Persons in poverty, percent
Bachelor's degree or higher, percent of persons age 25 years+
Persons under 18 years, percent
Persons 65 years and over, percent
Median household income
The project employs appropriate data analysis techniques, statistical methods, and visualizations to present the findings accurately and effectively. The insights gained from the analysis contribute to a better understanding of the trends in gun/firearm checks, highlight the states with the highest background checks, and explore potential correlations between gun checks and state-level metrics. Ultimately, the project sheds light on the FBI Gun Data's significance in relation to firearm purchasing eligibility and sociodemographic factors at the state level.
